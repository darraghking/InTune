## What is InTune?
InTune is an app I designed for guitarists or any other musicians to help tune their guitar or any other instrument by ear. It plays each of the 6 notes of standard E tuning on a 6 string guitar. It also has a few basic chords, with images to show how they are played and audio to hear how they sound. You can also download songs or any other audio file to this apps local storage by just dragging the file from your desktop or file explorer onto the main section of the app.  
InTune is designed to be a desktop app but can be used on your phone or tablet either. 

## How to Run
* Download or clone the git repository for this project
* Unzip the folder
* Install Visual Studio 2017 if you haven't already 
* Open project in Visual Studio 2017 and select run

### OR

Download the app from the Micrsoft store when it is available. I will post the link once it is done. 

## Features
I'm happy with what features I have on this app so far.
There is a search bar with suggestions, that lets you find a specific sound you want to play.
There is a categories column on the left that lets you filter what category you would like to listen to, and a back button appears when you have selected one of the categories that brings you back to the main section. 
You can drag and drop audio files onto the app too that saves into the users local storage. A snippet of the file is played once you place it onto the app. 

## Resources
The main resource I used for this project was [Learnonline](https://learnonline.gmit.ie/course/view.php?id=4195)

## Final Thoughts
Overall I'm happy with how this app turned out. If I had more time I would have added more chords and different tunings, but I'm happy with what I have on it so far. I would also like to have whatever file the user adds to local storage to be displayed on the app once it has been dropped. In the future, I would like to add a proper guitar tuner that uses the microphone from your machine.

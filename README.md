## What is InTune?
InTune is an app I designed for guitarists or any other musicians to help tune their guitar or any other instrument by ear. It plays each of the 6 notes of standard E tuning on a 6 string guitar. It also has a few basic chords, with images to show how they are played and audio to hear how they sound. You can also download songs or any other audio file to this apps local storage by just dragging the file onto the main section of the app.
